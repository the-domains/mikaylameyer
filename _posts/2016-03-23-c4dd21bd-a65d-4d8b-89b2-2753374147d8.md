\[Everlastingly\] innocent to the pains of the world

underestimating how hurtful it may be 

large Coffee eyes- translucent

-16 trips around the sun later-

addicted: to Coffee

understands the pain

closes out the world

hurt. alone. not in a lonely sort of way,

but in an- I want to be alone sort of way.

Take in the love. How?

Open my mind. How?

Think positive. How?

I want to forest

be forest

feel forest

adore forest

a subtile primary arc

into the tunnels of love

tear down my built up walls

difficult.
