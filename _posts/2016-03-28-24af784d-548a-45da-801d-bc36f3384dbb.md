Grow mushrooms in my decaying body 

Devoid of thought I have 

Wrap me in a quilt 

Put me into a plantain colored semi-truck where your thoughts are written on the walls and mine are in the dirt of the growing corn 

Repair the engine 

Travel 

Put coconut oil in my hair when we reach the coconut palms to help our energies bind 

When you reach the ocean- Pick the mushrooms- Burn my body -Take the yellow Ferry and dump the ashes-  Death
