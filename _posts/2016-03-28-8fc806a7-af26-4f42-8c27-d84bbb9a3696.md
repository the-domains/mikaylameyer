Objects in mirror are closer than they appear 

I am in a delusional state 

Vulnerable 

You are closer than I can understand 

Becoming dangerously close 

There is a lack of warning signs as we drive 

Blank mile marked relationship 

Twisted Roads 

No exit 

Stuck on cruise control 

Lungs smashing against ribs 

No 

Muscles condensing 

No. Can't say no.  No.
