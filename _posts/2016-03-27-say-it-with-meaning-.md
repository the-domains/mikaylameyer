Say it with meaning- 

-but what is meaning?

-what does it mean? mean.

Say each word repetitively and it starts to loose meaning.

If you tell me you love me too many times will it lose meaning?

This is my coping mechanism

ex- pain pai   n p ain pa i  n p  ain p ai n 

I've made so many words lose meaning in my life- 

& I'm not sure how to stop your words from losing meaning-

love love l ove lo   ve l   o   v  e
