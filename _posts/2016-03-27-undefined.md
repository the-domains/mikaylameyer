I am the ocean, my thoughts are still two thirds undiscovered because they are far too deep. Sail away on me, but no promises that you wont get lost in my soul. My heart can be your island when you can't sail any longer; you can swim through my veins- you can exist with me; flow in harmony. My waves are unpredictable.
