description: "Lecture to me about all that you think and feel. Lecture your thoughts aloud as if your words are biblical. I will drink your words as if they are my black coffee in the mornings. Show me your passion even if it's just an act- I will believe it. Passion to me is an attribute of Godly, higher powered, people."

Lecture to me about all that you think and feel. Lecture your thoughts aloud as if your words are biblical. I will drink your words as if they are my black coffee in the mornings. Show me your passion even if it's just an act- I will believe it. Passion to me is an attribute of Godly, higher powered, people. Next- I need you to listen to my lecture but before I speak- I need you to beg me to do so- I need to see your thirst for my passion- I need you to crave my presence, my words, my tone. Let our auras collide, let them dance, let our colors blend, let us become one.
