description: "I have began to lack the desire to be with you- lack the desire to talk to you- lack the ability to hold a conversation with you- and I lack the ability to be okay with the fact that we are not written in the stars. Maybe it is true that our love has always been a figment of my imagination. Imaginary love I thought we had? Gone.\_Demand a yellow Feeling, I crave it. I Eat yellow paint as if it was my drug. It forces me to feel something. I wish your love alone could make me feel alive.\_"

I have began to lack the desire to be with you- lack the desire to talk to you- lack the ability to hold a conversation with you- and I lack the ability to be okay with the fact that we are not written in the stars. Maybe it is true that our love has always been a figment of my imagination. Imaginary love I thought we had? Gone. Demand a yellow Feeling, I crave it. I Eat yellow paint as if it was my drug. It forces me to feel something. I wish your love alone could make me feel alive.
