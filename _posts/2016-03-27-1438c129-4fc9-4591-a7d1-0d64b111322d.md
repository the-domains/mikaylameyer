If you were to realize where my cares lie 

and how my mind insinuates that-  

-to be interesting
& 

-my strange indistinctive form of raw beauty
is what you should love me for as well as my art forms- 

would you want to know more? 

I feel that you don't appreciate the same strange things that I do. 

I'm happy to love myself.
