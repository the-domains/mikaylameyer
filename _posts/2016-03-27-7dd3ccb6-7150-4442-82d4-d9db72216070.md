Lecture to me about all that you think and feel. Lecture your thoughts aloud as if your words are biblical. I will drink your words as if they are my black coffee in the mornings. Show me your passion even if it's just an act- I will believe it. Passion to me is an attribute of Godly, higher powered, people. Next- I need you to listen to my lecture but before I speak- I need you to beg me to do so- I need to see your thirst for my passion- I need you to crave my presence, my words, my tone. Let our auras collide, let them dance, let our colors blend, let us become one.
