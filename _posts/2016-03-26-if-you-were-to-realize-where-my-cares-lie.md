If you were to realize where my cares lie

and how my mind insinuates that-

-to be interesting

&

-my strange indistinctive form of raw beauty

is what you should love me for as well as my art forms-

would you want to know more?

I feel that you don't appreciate the same strange things that I do.

I'm happy to love myself.
